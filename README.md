This website is my first attempt at a simple React App, which allows users to play connect 4.

Click [here](https://cjleggett.github.io/connect4/) to visit the site.

I would like to give credit to Brian Yu for the [source code](https://cs50.harvard.edu/beyond/2019/winter/lectures/) for this project.
